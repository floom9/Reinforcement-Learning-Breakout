# Reinforcement-Learning-Breakout
Applying Reinforcement Learning for the videogame Breakout (1976)

## Setup

To set up the virtual enviroment on your machine go into the repository folder and use 
```bash 
python -m venv venv
```
Note: The name venv is important as otherwise it will not be ignored by git (using the .gitignore file) and therefore cluter the repository for all with only locally usable files

To active the Virtual enviroment use 
(Linux)
```bash 
source venv/bin/activate
```


in the repositiory folder, then install all needed dependancies using 

```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
